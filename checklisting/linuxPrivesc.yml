🔥 Linux Privilege Escalation Checklist (OSCP-Oriented)
1️⃣ Initial Context
Current user:
Hostname:
Kernel version:
Architecture:
Distribution:
Shell type:


Check:

id
uname -a
cat /etc/os-release
sudo -l

2️⃣ Immediate Wins
🔹 Sudo
sudo -l


Check:

Can run as root?

NOPASSWD?

Wildcards?

Specific binaries allowed?

Environment variables preserved?

Sudo is one of the most common OSCP wins.

🔹 SUID Binaries
find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null


Check:

Non-standard binaries

Writable SUID files?

GTFOBins applicable?

Custom programs?

Reminder:

Custom SUID > standard SUID

🔹 Capabilities
getcap -r / 2>/dev/null


Look for:

cap_setuid

cap_setgid

cap_sys_admin

Capabilities are often overlooked.

3️⃣ Cron Jobs

Check:

crontab -l
cat /etc/crontab
ls -la /etc/cron*


Look for:

Writable scripts?

Writable directories?

Running as root?

Wildcard usage?

Cron misconfigs are common.

4️⃣ Writable Files / Directories

Search for:

Writable directories owned by root

Writable scripts executed by root

Writable service binaries

Key locations:

/etc/
/opt/
/usr/local/
/var/www/
/home/
/tmp/


Decision trigger:

Is root executing anything from a writable location?

5️⃣ Services / Processes

Check:

ps aux


Look for:

Custom services

Services running as root

Paths to service binaries

Misconfigured startup scripts

If systemd:

systemctl list-units --type=service


Check:

Writable service files?

Writable ExecStart paths?

6️⃣ Credential Hunting (Very Important)

Search for:

config files
database credentials
backup files
history files
.env files
SSH keys


Check:

/home/*/.ssh/
/root/
/var/www/
/opt/
/etc/
/backup/
/mnt/


Also:

cat ~/.bash_history


Credential reuse is huge in OSCP.

7️⃣ NFS

Check:

cat /etc/exports


If NFS share:

no_root_squash?

Writable?

Mountable?

NFS misconfig is a classic privesc.

8️⃣ Docker / Containers

Check:

groups


If user in:

docker
lxd


Possible container breakout.

Also check:

/var/run/docker.sock

9️⃣ PATH Hijacking

Check:

echo $PATH


Look for:

Writable directories in PATH

Root scripts calling binaries without full path

Common trick.

🔟 Kernel Exploits (Last Resort)

Only if:

Old kernel

No misconfigs found

Checklist:

Check exact kernel version
Search for known privilege escalation exploits
Verify exploit stability
Test carefully


Do not jump here early.

11️⃣ Network / Internal Services

Sometimes local privesc is:

Redis running as root

MySQL with weak creds

Local-only service accessible

Check:

netstat -tulnp
ss -tulnp

12️⃣ SSH Keys

Check:

Private keys readable?

Reuse?

Root SSH access allowed?

13️⃣ If Stuck Reminder

Add this at bottom:

Re-check sudo
Re-check SUID
Re-check cron
Re-check writable scripts
Search for credentials again
Look for custom binaries
Think misconfiguration, not exploit
