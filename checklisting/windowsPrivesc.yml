Good. Windows privesc is where people either farm easy points or waste 2 hours.

You don’t want a 20-page encyclopedia.
You want a decision-driven checklist that forces you to look in the right places fast.

Here’s a clean, complete, OSCP-focused Windows PrivEsc template you can expand.

🔥 Windows Privilege Escalation Checklist (OSCP-Oriented)
1️⃣ Initial Situation
Current user:
Hostname:
OS version:
Architecture:
Domain joined? (Y/N)
Integrity level:

2️⃣ Basic Context
whoami /all

Privileges:
if they show up at all, my user has them

3️⃣ Local Admin Check
Is current user local admin?
net localgroup administrators


If yes:

Dump SAM

Dump LSASS

Extract credentials

Check reuse

Pivot

People forget this step.

4️⃣ Services (Very Important Section)

Enumerate services.

Check for:

Unquoted service paths?
Writable service binary?
Writable service directory?
Can modify service config?
Service running as SYSTEM?


Decision triggers:

If path has spaces → unquoted test

If writable → replace binary

If you can change binpath → reconfigure

Services are common OSCP wins.

5️⃣ Scheduled Tasks
schtasks /query /fo LIST /v


Check:

Running as SYSTEM?

Writable script?

Writable task file?

Custom script path?

6️⃣ Startup / Autoruns

Check:

Startup folders

Registry Run keys

Writable locations?

If writable → replace binary.

7️⃣ Registry Checks

Look for:

AlwaysInstallElevated?


Check both:

HKLM

HKCU

If enabled → MSI execution as SYSTEM.

Also check:

Service registry keys writable?

Unquoted paths via registry?

8️⃣ DLL Hijacking Opportunities

Look for:

Missing DLLs

Writable directories in PATH

Custom services loading local DLLs

Trigger:

Process running as SYSTEM?
Loads DLL from writable location?

9️⃣ Token Impersonation

If:

SeImpersonatePrivilege enabled


Then:

Potato-style attack possible?

Named pipe abuse?

PrintSpoofer-like method?

This is one of the most common modern privesc paths.

🔟 Credential Hunting

Search for:

config files
unattend.xml
web.config
sysprep
saved creds
registry stored creds


Also:

cmdkey /list


Saved credentials are often overlooked.

11️⃣ File System Checks

Search for:

Writable program directories

Writable service folders

Sensitive files readable

Backup files

Check:

C:\Program Files
C:\Program Files (x86)
C:\inetpub
C:\xampp
C:\Users\OtherUsers\

12️⃣ UAC Bypass (If Admin but Not High Integrity)

If:

Local admin

Medium integrity

Check:

Auto-elevated binaries

UAC bypass method

OSCP sometimes includes this.

13️⃣ Kernel Exploits (Last Resort)

Only if:

Old OS

Clearly vulnerable build

No easier path

Checklist:

Check build number
Match exploit carefully
Test safely


Don’t jump here early.

14️⃣ Domain Context (If Domain Joined)

Ask:

Is this machine domain joined?
Am I local admin?
Any domain creds cached?
LSASS dump viable?


Sometimes Windows privesc becomes AD pivot.

🔁 If Stuck Reminder

Add this at bottom:

Re-run manual enumeration.
Check writable paths again.
Check services again.
Check privileges again.
Search for credentials again.
Think misconfiguration, not exploit.
